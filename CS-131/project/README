Manual:

To set up the server, the command format is as following:

> python3 server_herd.py [server_name]

Note:

At line 9, there is a debug_flag.
If you don't want to see anything print out while the server is running,
please toggle the debug_flag from True to False,
then nothing would be printed out, but still logged.
